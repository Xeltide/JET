###Guidelines:

- Claim tasks on Trello in a cards comments with "Claimed"
	* Also attach the blue "Claimed" label to the card to make it quicker to browse tasks
- Do not redundantly work on tasks
	* First come, first serve
	* Only do this if you're coordinating
- Claimed tasks will be entered back into the task pool after two weeks if somebody has queued for the task and no response has been received on the card
- Work on your own branch
- If you need help, attach a purple label to your task or reach out to another member
- All "completed" tasks are to be tested thoroughly **before** merging
	* Purposeful or excesive premature merging will result in bans
- Comment your code
	* Google checkstyle is a good baseline
- Be respectful to others
